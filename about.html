    <h6>The about page was added after completion, and has nothing to do with the project itself. It is simply here to explain the project itself.</h6>
    <p>This snake game was made to test and challenge some of my coding abilities, and the main advertising point is the javascript itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing I worked on was taking a generic snake game from the internet (see <a href="reference.html">reference.html</a>) and making it customizeable.</li>
        <li>I started by making the speed adjustable, and the gamesize be any whole positive number</li>
        <li>I ran into a problem sometime close to the end when I got a new PC and realized that the speed of the game was directly tied to the framerate of the display it was on</li>
        <li>I then worked on making the options page, and had to figure out hot to pass options from one page to the other. I did this by using the handy URL parameters that you often see in many pages like youtube, spotify and other content delivery pages</li>
        <li>After that I worked on the score system which took advantage of cookies to store variables. this was also going to be how I stored the settings, but I was approaching my deadline so I decided to simply have it hold the highscore and update when a new one was met</li>
        <li>finally the game was done. I added some styling, and was produ of what I had made.</li>
    </ul>
